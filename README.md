# Quizboard

## The goal with this assessment is to exercise your JavaScript / jQuery skills.

I am giving you all that you need on the Rails side, and I am looking for you to
set up the front-end of the application. The behavior of the application is a
quiz application.

I have also included bootstrap in the application and presented a demo page with
the buttons you can use to mark an answer as correct or incorrect.


## Requirements

- Show a question
- Show the possible answers to the question
- Upon selecting an answer, show the correct answer and indicate if they were
  incorrect
- Disable the all of the possible answer buttons up an answer selection
- Keep track of the progress of the quiz (1/4 where 1 is the question they are
  on and 4 is the total questions)
- Upon completing the quiz a user should be presented with their score as a
  percentage
